# Parametric_Earpods
Made a python file to input some variables in command line to create required 3d model of earpods

Hey folks , I have created this amazing mini project where you can easily define and make a 3d model of earpods just by using a few command line arguments.

1. The height of vertical part of earpods -> command line input as  --length.
2. The radius of silicone earbud and connecting part -> command line input as --radius.
3. The width of connecting part -> command line input as --width.
4. The thickness of silicone earbud -> command line input as --bud-thickness

To run the file do the following 
Step 1 -> Clone the repo and open in any code editor like VS Code
Step 2 -> pip install all the dependencies
Step 3 -> Once you are done with above steps you are ready to go.
Step 4 -> Write this in terminal "python model.py --radius 0.55 --length 7 --width 1.4 --bud-thickness 0.4"

And you are done !!!

A 3d-model like this will appear , if it is not looking same please do rotate this a bit using your mouse to see it properly.
